# SEF - Smart and open obstacle detection assistance
SEF is an open source device designed to aid blind and visually impaired people in navigating environments by providing close-range obstacle detection.

This repository contains the documentation needed for the development of a portable aid device for blind and visually impaired people meant to assist in the navigation of unknown environments.
The tool performs close-range obstacle detection by using a proximity sensor which can be directed by the user through wrist movement.
When an obstacle is encountered, the device sends out a vibrating signal to the user as a warning. The intensity of the vibration varies according to the distance of the obstruction: the closer it is, the stronger the signal. 

- This project is made using Arduino technology: the Arduino sketch can be found in the "Application" folder. 
- The documentation for the hardware library can be found the "docs" folder, inside the "index.html" file.
- The electronic schematics for the prototype and the final version are stored in the "Hardware schematics" folder.
- The 3D models of the casing can be found in the "Casing" folder.
